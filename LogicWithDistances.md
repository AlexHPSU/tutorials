# Logic with Distance Sensors

Let's learn some basic logic by working through a robot that will turn on an LED if it's ultrasonic sensor detects something in front of it.

## Importing the NewPing Library
In order to use our distance sensor we need to import the NewPing library. 

Under `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries` search for the NewPing library. Install version `1.9.1`

## Writing the program
### Setting up the Ultrasonic sensor
Let's first connect our sensor to the Arduino.
Here's a diagram to follow:
